    "description": "I had been working as the Lead Engineer for uSTADIUM, a startup in New York since starting grad school in 2017. After graduation, we made plans for me to move to New York City and work closely with the team. On December 31st, 2018 I took a red-eye flight to NYC and started my 2019 there.  My time at uSTADIUM was a fantastic experience, and I learned so much about who I am and what I can accomplish as an engineer."

    "description": "I decided to return for a Master's degree after the company I was working at closed down. My goal was to build a well-rounded computer science education by focusing on my weaknesses and leaning into the hard parts. I took courses in logic, programming languages, algorithms, and data science. Getting my masters was the most challenging and rewarding time of my academic career. I powered through the program, overcame hurdles I never thought I could, and in less than two years, I was graduating again!"
